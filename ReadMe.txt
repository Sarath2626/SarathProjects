Here is a breakdown of the project components and how they work together:

### Project Structure

1. **Page Object Model (POM)**
   - `pojoFitepeo.java`: This class contains the web elements and actions for the Revenue Calculator page on the FitPeo website.

2. **Test Runner**
   - `TC01.java`: This class contains the test case that interacts with the web elements defined in `pojoFitepeo.java`.

3. **Helper**
   - `Base.java`: This class provides the setup and teardown methods for the WebDriver, as well as utility methods like `highlightElement` and `takeScreenshot`.

4. **Configuration**
   - `constant.java`: This class contains constants like URLs and other configuration values.

5. **Maven POM (pom.xml)**
   - Contains dependencies required for the project like Selenium, TestNG, and WebDriverManager.

### Explanation of Each Component

#### `Base.java`
This class sets up and tears down the WebDriver instance for the tests.

- `browserLaunch()`: Initializes the ChromeDriver and configures it to exclude automation-specific switches.
- `tearDown()`: Cleans up the WebDriver instance after each test method.
- `highlightElement(WebElement element)`: Highlights a web element by adding a red border around it.
- `takeScreenshot(WebElement element)`: Takes a screenshot of the current page and highlights a specific element.

#### `pojoFitepeo.java`
This class is the Page Object Model for the Revenue Calculator page. It uses the `@FindBy` annotation to locate web elements.

- `headerRevenueBtn`: Button to navigate to the Revenue Calculator page.
- `revenuecard`, `revenueslider`, `revenuesliderinputbox`, etc.: Various web elements on the Revenue Calculator page.
- The constructor initializes the web elements using `PageFactory`.

#### `TC01.java`
This class contains the test case that interacts with the Revenue Calculator page.

- `tc01()`: This method navigates to the FitPeo homepage, verifies the URL, interacts with the Revenue Calculator, and validates the results.

### Execution Flow

1. **Setup WebDriver**
   - The `Base` class's `browserLaunch()` method is called before each test method to initialize the WebDriver.

2. **Navigate to FitPeo Homepage**
   - The test case navigates to the homepage and verifies the URL.

3. **Navigate to Revenue Calculator Page**
   - Clicks on the `headerRevenueBtn` to navigate to the Revenue Calculator page and verifies the URL.

4. **Interact with Revenue Calculator**
   - Scrolls to the slider section and adjusts the slider.
   - Clicks on the input field, updates its value, and verifies the new value.

5. **Select CPT Codes**
   - Scrolls and selects various CPT codes, verifying each selection.

6. **Validate Results**
   - Validates the total recurring reimbursement and verifies that the header is displaying the correct value.

7. **Tear Down WebDriver**
   - The `Base` class's `tearDown()` method is called after each test method to clean up the WebDriver instance.

### Notes on the `pom.xml` File

- **Selenium**: Provides the necessary libraries for interacting with web elements.
- **TestNG**: Used for structuring and running the test cases.
- **WebDriverManager**: Manages the WebDriver binaries automatically.

### Tips for Maintenance

- **Page Object Model**: Keep web elements and actions related to a specific page in their own class. This makes it easier to maintain and update when the UI changes.
- **Reusable Methods**: Use the `Base` class for common setup, teardown, and utility methods to avoid code duplication.
- **Assertions**: Use assertions to validate the test steps and outcomes, ensuring that each step is performing as expected.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Keep the code well-commented and document each method's purpose for better readability and maintainability.

This should give you a comprehensive overview of your project structure and how the components work together.
